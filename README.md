## Guan package

Guan is an open source python package, dealing with tight-binding models by calculating band structures, density of states, quantum transport, topological invariant, etc. Other trivial functions are also integrated, including file reading/writing, figure plotting, data processing. The official website is https://py.guanjihuan.com.
